This project is a SQLite endeavor presented in a Jupyter Notebook. It revolves around the utilization of the database file "movies.db," comprising five interconnected tables:

1)"movies" table
2)"directors" table
3)"stars" table
4)"people" table
5)"ratings" table

The project endeavors to address 20 queries, exemplified by inquiries such as "What are the top 5 directors with the highest average ratings for their movies?" These queries employ various selection techniques and joins to extract pertinent information from the database.
